      <p> ... (I am a passionate computer science student who loves coding and exploring new technologies.
I enjoy building websites, solving problems, and learning how software systems work.
My goal is to become a skilled software engineer who can design efficient and user-friendly applications.
I started learning programming in my first year at college, and since then I have worked with languages like C++, Java, HTML, and CSS.
I like to practice by creating small projects that help me understand each concept deeply.
In my free time, I watch tutorials, read tech blogs, and experiment with new frameworks.
I believe continuous learning is the key to success in the technology field.
Programming challenges sometimes feel hard, but solving them gives me great satisfaction and confidence.
I am currently improving my front-end and back-end skills, aiming to become a full-stack developer.
I also want to learn more about artificial intelligence and mobile app development.
I believe that technology can make life easier and help people communicate, learn, and grow.
